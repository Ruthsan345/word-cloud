# # Word Cloud

# For this project, you'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script.  This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.  A dictionary is the output of the `calculate_frequencies` function.  The `wordcloud` module will then generate the image from your dictionary.

# Here are all the installs and imports you will need for your word cloud script and uploader widget

# Whew! That was a lot. All of the installs and imports for your word cloud script and uploader widget have been completed.

# **IMPORTANT!** If this was your first time running the above cell containing the installs and imports, you will need save this notebook now. Then under the File menu above,  select Close and Halt. When the notebook has completely shut down, reopen it. This is the only way the necessary changes will take affect.

# The uploader widget saved the contents of your uploaded file into a string object named *file_contents* that your word cloud script can process. This was a lot of preliminary work, but you are now ready to begin your script. 

# Write a function in the cell below that iterates through the words in *file_contents*, removes punctuation, and counts the frequency of each word.  Oh, and be sure to make it ignore word case, words that do not contain all alphabets and boring words like "and" or "the".  Then use it in the `generate_from_frequencies` function to generate your very own word cloud!
# <br><br>
# **Hint:** Try storing the results of your iteration in a dictionary before passing them into wordcloud via the `generate_from_frequencies` function.

# If you have done everything correctly, your word cloud image should appear after running the cell below.  Fingers crossed!

# In[9]:


# Display your wordcloud image

myimage = calculate_frequencies(file_contents)
plt.imshow(myimage, interpolation = 'nearest')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()


# If your word cloud image did not appear, go back and rework your `calculate_frequencies` function until you get the desired output.  Definitely check that you passed your frequecy count dictionary into the `generate_from_frequencies` function of `wordcloud`. Once you have correctly displayed your word cloud image, you are all done with this project. Nice work!
